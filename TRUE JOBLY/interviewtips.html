        <blockquote>
            <p>"The interview begins the moment you enter the building. Every interaction - with reception, other candidates, or staff - contributes to the interviewer's impression of you."</p>

        <h2>Common Interview Questions & Expert Answers</h2>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>1. Could you tell me about yourself and describe your background in brief?</h3>
            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is your elevator pitch - concise, compelling, and tailored to the role. Focus on professional journey, key achievements, and what brings you to this opportunity.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I'm a marketing professional with 5 years of experience specializing in digital campaigns. At my current company, I led a team that increased social media engagement by 150% through data-driven content strategies. I'm particularly excited about this opportunity because your focus on innovative customer engagement aligns perfectly with my expertise in..."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>2. How did you hear about this position?</h3>
            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Demonstrate your proactive approach and genuine interest in the company.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I've been following your company's growth in renewable energy solutions and was excited to see this opening on your careers page. Your recent project in solar-powered irrigation systems particularly caught my attention because it combines my engineering background with my passion for sustainable technology."</p>
        </div>
        

        <div class="question">
            <h3>3. What type of work environment do you prefer?</h3>
            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Align your answer with the company's known culture while being authentic.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I thrive in collaborative environments where teams work together to solve complex problems, which I understand is a key part of your company culture. At the same time, I appreciate having autonomy to manage my projects and deadlines. Your mention of weekly cross-departmental brainstorming sessions in the job description particularly appealed to me."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>4. How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?</h3>
            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Show self-awareness, coping mechanisms, and a growth mindset.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I've developed a three-step approach to stressful situations: First, I assess priorities to focus on what matters most. Second, I break large problems into manageable steps. Third, I communicate proactively with stakeholders. During our product launch last quarter, this approach helped me coordinate between engineering and marketing when we had to accelerate our timeline by two weeks."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>5. Do you prefer working independently or on a team?</h3>
            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Show flexibility and understanding of when each approach is appropriate.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I appreciate the balance of both. I enjoy the creative energy of collaborative work - some of my best ideas have come from team brainstorming sessions. At the same time, I'm comfortable taking ownership of projects and working independently when needed. In my last role, I typically spent mornings working independently on analysis and afternoons collaborating with the sales team to develop client strategies."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>Salary Negotiation Tip</h3>
            <p>When asked about salary expectations, consider responding: "I'm open to discussion based on the total compensation package and growth opportunities. Could you share the range budgeted for this position?" This keeps the conversation open while ensuring you don't undervalue yourself.</p>
